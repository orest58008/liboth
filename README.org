#+TITLE: /Lib/rary that transforms /O/rg in/t/o /H/TML

* Skinless output
liboth supplies [[https://nerdy.dev/headless-boneless-and-skinless-ui#skinless-ui][skinless]] HTML
output that is designed to be stylable and JS-able by the user.

* Inline HTML support
liboth deviates from orgmode standard in that it can include inline HTML (<b>bold</b> is possible
instead of =*bold*=).

To escape =/= in closing tags, escape it by doubling it (=//=). This can also be done with other
styling characters (=*=, =_=, ===, =~= and =+=)
