#+TITLE: /Lib/rary that transforms /O/rg in/t/o /H/TML

* Skinless output
liboth supplies [[https://nerdy.dev/headless-boneless-and-skinless-ui#skinless-ui][skinless]] HTML
output that is designed to be stylable and JS-able by the user.

* Difference from org standard
** Inline HTML support
liboth supports inline HTML (<b>bold</b> is possible instead of =*bold*=).

*NB!* =/= in closing tags should be [[#Style-character-escaping][escaped]].

** Style character escaping
Style characters (===, =*=, =/=, =+=, =_= and =~=) can be escaped by doubling them. E.g., to escape
=/=, use =//=.
